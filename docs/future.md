Planned Features
====

A list of features which will eventually make it into the framework.

* `LineInterface` performance testing

	This should be wrapped in the `TestSuite` utility and will be reported along with the cache performance results. This additional performance test should test for 
	`LineInterface::load` and `LineInterface::unload` latencies.

* developer's library

	A library of common cache designs to be implemented using the `cachepp` framework. May or may not be included in **this** (versus external) repository.

* tutorial

	A guided tutorial on implementing `CacheInterface` and `LineInterface` using this framework.

* C / Python API bindings

	**Maybe.**

Feature requests should be directed to the project [issues](https://github.com/cripplet/cachepp/issues) page.
